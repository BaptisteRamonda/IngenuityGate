# IngenuityGate

This directory contains the work of Peter PIRIOU--DEZY, Baptiste RAMONDA and Constant ROUX as part of an Ingenuity project at the UPSSITECH engineering school.
The aim of this project is to voice-control a portal model and display the feedback from these commands on a Whiteboard, displaying the prompt as well as the sensor feedback.
