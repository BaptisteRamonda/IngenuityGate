# Ingenuity Gate
## Presentation

The Ingenuity Gate project is part of the Robotic and Interactive Systems (SRI) program at the UPSSITECH engineering school, and more specifically of the “Distributed Interaction” course. The main objective of this project was to design a project using Ingescape, a software suite dedicated to Systems Engineering, Software Interoperability and Human-System Integration. The only guideline imposed was the use of a Whiteboard, employed here as a display screen, as one of the central element of the project.

Our group, made up of Peter PIRIOU-DEZY, Baptiste RAMONDA and Constant ROUX, opted to create a model of a gate, whose opening and closing is voice-controlled. The whiteboard screen would then be used as visual feedback indicating the system's current state of opening and closing. It would also be used to display the various voice prompts issued to the system.
